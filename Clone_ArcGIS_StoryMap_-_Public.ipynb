(It is not for cloning Classic StoryMap apps.)\n\nThe goal of this Notebook is to support situations where a \"full\" clone of StoryMap is required. Where the person creating the StoryMap wants to keep a copy for themselves, under their full control, however, they also need to provide a copy of the StoryMap to someone else, who will then have full control over that copy.\n\nThis Notebook defines \"full\" clone as cloning not only the StoryMap, but also any referenced content in the StoryMap that is owned by the same user as the StoryMap. Cloning referenced content is supported for the major content types (images, express maps, web maps, web scenes, feature layers, tile layers, etc.) For unsupported content types, the reference to the orignal item wil be carried through to the cloned StoryMap. Similarly, for referenced content that is not owned by the same user, the reference to the original item will be maintained in the clone.\n\nThe sharing settings for the StoryMap and its related content are not currently cloned. Cloned content is private to the owner."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Some Additional Notes\n* The code in this Notebook is designed for readability and understanding of the various steps. It is not optimized.\n* It is generally recommended that the user running this Notebook have the built-in Administrator role. The user running the Notebook needs to have full access to the StoryMap (and any referenced content) to create a full copy. If the user only has view access to the StoryMap, then the Notebook can only clone the published version of the StoryMap. Any unpublished edits in the draft version will not be accessible, and, therefore, not included in the cloned StoryMap. (The latter situation can occur even when running as an Administrator, if you are not an Administrator on the system from which the StoryMap is beling cloned; for example, when you are cloning a StoryMap from a public ArcGIS Online account.)\n* If a StoryMap is shared with a Shared Update group, then the user running this Notebook need only be a member of that group with access to edit the StoryMap for the Notebook to be able to clone any draft version of the StoryMap, in addition to the published version.\n* Cloning a StoryMap produces a new item, which means a new URL. For certain use cases, you may want to change the ownershp of the original StoryMap (and appropriate referenced content) to the person for whom the clone is being made, so that references to the original URL are maintained, and then clone the StoryMap back to the original owner. For example, if a student makes StoryMap on behalf of faculty member, and the faculty member has already been distributing or linking to that StoryMap's URL, then it would be best to make the faculty member the owner of the original StoryMap, and produce a clone of it for the student.\n* The sharing settings for the original StoryMap are not carried over to the clone. The cloned StoryMap is initially only visible to its owner.\n* The code below assumes you are using built-in ArcGIS accounts to connect to your source and target GIS systems. If either or both use enterprise logins instead, like SAML or ADFS, then you will need to modify the connection process for your particular systems' configurations. For example, with SAML, you are usually redirected to a web page to login, so you do not put your username and password in the Notebook, as you do for a built-in account. For an overview of using different authentication schemes with the ArcGIS API for Python, please see [Working with different authentication schemes](https://developers.arcgis.com/python/guide/working-with-different-authentication-schemes/). \n* Cloning of StoryMaps with Custom Themes is not currently fully supported. The cloned StoryMap will end up using a default StoryMap Theme. You can separately clone or recreate your Custom Theme and apply it to the cloned StoryMap."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Warnings and Errors\n* The code may generate warning messages when it isn't sure what to do, such as when it encounters a version of StoryMaps that it wasn't previously tested against.\n* If you have a very complex or large StoryMap, then the clone_items() method may not be able to complete within the ArcGIS Online execution time limit. Sometimes buried in the error messages ArcGIS returns there is mention of a timeout, but not always. If you get an error in one of the cells that uses clone_items(), and it has been running for more than 10 minutes, then it is probably an error related to a timeout. Unfortunately, it is not possible to override this limit. (If you're comfortable with Python, and clone_items() is failing when working on multiple items, then you could try breaking up the call into multiple calls that clone fewer items at one time.)"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Initialization"},{"metadata":{"trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"import arcgis\nfrom arcgis import GIS\nfrom arcgis import mapping\nfrom arcgis import features\nimport datetime\nimport json\nfrom pkg_resources import parse_version\n\n# Minimum and maxium known versions of ArcGIS StoryMaps for which this script is known to work.\n# (Note that older versions of StoryMaps can be updated to the latest verison by re-publishing them.)\nminimum_storymap_version = parse_version('20.0.0')\nmaximum_storymap_version = parse_version('23.2.385')    # lastest known version, circa January 2023.","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Check that the version of the ArcGIS API for Python in the current environment. \nif( parse_version(arcgis.__version__) < parse_version('1.7.0') ):\n    print(\"This Notebook is known to work in version 1.7.0-1.8.4 of the ArcGIS API for Python.\")\n    print(\"You are using an earlier version of the API {0}.
